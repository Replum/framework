 * The rt element marks the ruby text component of a ruby annotation. When it is the child of a ruby element or of an rtc element that is itself the child of a ruby element, it doesn't represent anything itself, but its ancestor ruby element uses it as part of determining what it represents.
 *
 * An rt element that is not a child of a ruby element or of an rtc element that is itself the child of a ruby element represents the same thing as its children.
